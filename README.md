# rc-configs

This repository holds configuration files for shell, vim, crontab etc.

## .zshrc
ZSH configuration. On mac: 
1. `cd` into this repo 
2. `echo "source $PWD/.zshrc" >> ~/.zshrc` to activate the file in your `zshrc`. 

Note that this appends this command to your setup, so you can add multiple config files if needed.
